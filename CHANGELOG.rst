The format is based on `Keep a Changelog`_
and this project tries to adhere to `Semantic Versioning`_.

.. _`Keep a Changelog`: http://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/
.. _`Semantic Versioning`: http://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html

1.0.0 - 2025-02-18
==================

Fixed
-----

* parsetab.py file
* PyPI distribution procedure for devs

Added
-----

* Requirements for build and twine for devs


0.14.0 - 2025-02-17
===================

Added
-----

* Support for Python 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 (#97 and #111, thanks to @cclauss and @alexgarel)
* Support for negative values in range (#101, thanks to @mesemus)
* Docs on OpenRangeTransformer (#110, thanks to @alexgarel)

Removed
-------

* Support for Python 3.6, 3.7, 3.8 and 3.9 (#111, thanks to @alexgarel)

Fixed
-----

* Improved global state management for lexer (#109, thanks to @Morikko)
* Recognize E_NESTED override (#103, thanks to @maksle)


0.13.0 - 2023-03-24
===================

Added
-----

* Add support for unbounded ranges

  Support is added for open ranges, i.e. inequality operators in
  front of a term. In tree form, the < is named To, and > is named From.

  Additionally, a TreeTransformer is also added, to convert these
  open ranges to more traditional Range objects.

  To properly support escaping, some adjustments were made to how escaping
  sequences work. After careful evaluation of how Apache Lucene handles
  escape sequences, it appears that random characters can be escaped, even
  if they result in unknown escape sequences: the escaped character is
  always yielded. This makes support for operations such as `<\=foo` a lot
  less complicated.

  There is no support in the ElasticsearchQueryBuilder.

0.12.1 - 2023-02-08
===================

Fixed
-----

- Precedence for unknown operation and boost (#89, thanks to @JSCU-CNI)


0.12.0 - 2022-10-13
===================

Changed
-------

- Boost can be implicit ; by default, the boost factor is 1

Added
-----

- Add support for Lucene and Elasticsearch Boolean operations (#71, thanks to @linefeedse):

  * Introduce the BooleanOperation
  * add its resolution in ElasticSearch transformer
  * add it as a possible resolver for the unknown operation (no explicit operator in query)

- Set E element as ElasticsearchQueryBuilder's attributes (#75, thanks to @qcoumes):

  This allows to override elements such as EMust, EWord, ...,
  without the need of overriding ElasticsearchQueryBuilder's methods.

- Explicit support for Python 3.9 and Python 3.10 (#76)
- Add a thread safe parse function (#82)

Fixed
-----

- Cast TokenValue.__str__ return value to string (#74, thanks to @delkopiso)
- Isolated comma should be parsed as a Word (#80)
- Better handling of escaped wildcards

Docs
----

- Add boolean operation to doc
- Fix quick start documentation
- Updated readthedocs instructions

CI
--

- Run tests with github actions
- Update all libraries for dev:

  * switch from nose to pytest as nose is not python3.10 compatible
  * remove old travis tests

0.11.0 - 2021-01-06
===================

Changed
-------

- completely modified the naming module and `auto_name` function, as it was not practical as is.

Added
-----

- added tools to build visual explanations about why a request matches a results
  (leveraging `elasticsearch named queries`__.
- added a visitor and transformer that tracks path to element while visiting the tree.

__ https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-body.html#request-body-search-queries-and-filters

Fixed
-----

- fixed the handling of names when transforming luqum tree to elasticsearch queries
  and added integration tests.


0.10.0 - 2020-09-22
===================

Added
-----

- support for parsing Regular expressions like `/foo/` (no transformation to ElasticsearchÂ DSL yet)
- basic support for head and tail of expressions (the separators)
  and for their position (pos and size) in original text
- added `auto_head_tail` util
  (use it if you build your tree programatically and want a printable representation)
- tree item now support a `clone_item` method and a setter for children.
  This should help with making transformation pattern easier.
- New `visitor.TreeVisitor` and `visitor.TreeTransformer` classes to help in processing trees
  `utils.LuceneTreeVisitor`, `utils.LuceneTreeVisitorV2` and `utils.LuceneTreeTransformer`
  are warned as deprecated (but still works).

Changed
-------

- support for python 3.8 added, support for python 3.4 and 3.5 dropped
- better printing of Proximity and Fuzzy items (preserve implicit nature of degree)
- raise `IllegalCharacterError` on illegal character found instead of printing and skipping
- renamed `ParseError` to `ParseSyntaxError`, and kept `ParseError` as a parent exception

Fixed
-----

- Range item were not checking for bounds type on equality
- Boost item were not checking for force on equality
- Reorganize tests

0.9.0 - 2020-07-29
==================

Added
-----

- support for elasticsearch 7

0.8.1 - 2019-11-01
==================

Added
-----

- added Apache 2 license, while maintaining LGPLv3+

0.8.0 - 2019-08-02
==================

Added
-----

- support for `multi_match` query in `ElasticsearchQueryBuilder`.

Fixed
-----

- SchemaAnalyzer, should count non text fields as not_analyzed
- `ElasticsearchQueryBuilder`'s `field_options` parameter
  can accept `match_type` instead of `type` to change request type.
  This is now the prefered way over `type`
  which may more easily conflict with request parameters.

0.7.5 - 2018-10-29
==================

Added
-----

- handling sub fields (aka `multi-fields`__)

__ https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/6.3/multi-fields.html

Fixed
-----

- fixed bug on equality, having more children in one tree than in the other,
  was not triggering inequality if first nodes were the same !

0.7.4 - 2018-08-28
==================

Added
-----

- handling `special characters escaping`_
- added `iter_wildcards` and `split_wildcards` to have a finer grained search of wildcard in terms

.. _`special characters escaping`: https://lucene.apache.org/core/3_6_0/queryparsersyntax.html#Escaping%20Special%20Characters

Fixed
-----

- fixed bug in `luqum.utils.LuceneTreeTransformer` when removing node
- fixed bug in handling approx operator on multiple words in
  `luqum.elasticsearch.visitor.ElasticsearchQueryBuilder`
- test coverage now check branch

0.7.3 - 2018-06-08
===================

Fixed
-----

- On ElasticSearch query transformation, Luqum was interpreting wildcards in Phrases where as it should not

0.7.2 - 2018-05-14
===================

Fixed
-----

- adding the `zero_terms_query` to `match_phrase` was a mistake (introduced in 0.7.0).

Added
-----

- 0.7.0 introduced the `match` query for queries with single words on analyzed fields,
  whereas before it was using `match_phrase`.
  Although this is more coherent,
  this may cause difficulties on edge cases
  as this may leads to results different from previous release.

  This behaviour might be disabled using a new `match_word_as_phrase` parameter
  to `luqum.elasticsearch.visitor.ElasticsearchQueryBuilder`.
  Note that this parameter maybe removed in future release.
  (the `field_options` might be used instead on a per field basis).


0.7.1 - 2018-03-20
==================

Fixed
-----

- version introduced because of a bad upload on pypi (Restructured description error)

0.7.0 - 2018-03-20
==================

Added
-----

- Support for named queries (see `elastic named queries`__)
- Helper to automatically create ElasticSearch query builder options from the index configuration,
  see: `luqum.elasticsearch.schema`
- a new arg `field_options` on `luqum.elasticsearch.visitor.ElasticsearchQueryBuilder`
  allows to add parameters to field queries.
  It also permits to control the type of query for match queries.
- now for a query with a single word, if the field is analyzed,
  the transformation to elastic search query will use a "match" query instead of a "match_phrase".
  This is more conform in behaviour to what the expression of "query_string" would produce.


Fixed
-----

- small fix in utils.TreeTransformerV2,
  which was not removing elements from lists or tuple as stated
- single word matches, are now `match`, and not `match_phrase`
- `match_phrase` has the `zero_terms_query` field, as for `match`

__ https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-named-queries-and-filters.html

Changed
--------

- dropped official Python 3.3 support
